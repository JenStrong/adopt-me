# Adopt Me

## Overview

This is a JS and React web application that displays the images and descriptions of pets available for adoption. The information is pulled from the Petfinder API. I built this project following the [Frontend Masters Complete Intro to React v4](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/) course.

## How it Works

## Getting Started

## How to add your own Petfinder API credentials

1. Sign up for an API key [here](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key).
2. Create a file in the root of your project directoy that is called .env .
3. Add the following to your .env file.

```
API_KEY=<Your API key>
API_SECRET=<Your API secret>
```
