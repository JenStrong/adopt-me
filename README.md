# Adopt Me

## Overview

This is a JS and React web application that displays the images and descriptions of pets available for adoption. The information is pulled from the Petfinder API. I built this project following the [Frontend Masters Complete Intro to React v4](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/) course.

As a potential pet adopter,
So I can decide if the pet I find cute is a good fit for me,
I would like to see additional information and photos for each individual pet.
